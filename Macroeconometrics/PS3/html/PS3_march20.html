%% Macroeconometrics PS3
%Instructions: this problem set aims at replicating some of the results in Beaudry and Portier (AER 2006). You can work in groups of two. I need the .m files you use and a .pdf file reporting the results and a brief explanation of the results. The files must be included in a single .zip file. The name of the file must contain the names of the two students. The file Data.xlsx contains data for many US macroeconomic series. Column CY is the growth rates of TFP (adjusted for capacity utilization) and column CJ is the level of real stock prices (S&P500).

%% Problem 9
% Now enlarge the model considered in the previous point by adding the first 4 principal 
% components of the data contained in Data.xls. Estimate a VAR(2) with the four variables 
% and the principal components (8 variables in total). Identify the news shocks as in point 6.



%1. perform an ADF test to each variable to determine if it is stationary
%   or not. If it is not stationary, take first diference and take logs

%2. Once all the variables are stationary we find the var-cov matrix 

%3. Diagonilize the var-cov matrix sich that we obtain a representation of
%   the form $\Sigma=VDV^{-1}$

%4. Since the order of the eigen values in $D$ is asending , we sellect the
%   last 4 columns (the 4 components) 

%5. We then multiply the previews matrix by the variables matrix and
%   obtaining in that way the matrix of 4XT principal components
